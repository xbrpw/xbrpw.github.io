	<h1>Tips for keeping fish</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The bigger the tank or aquarium the better. Most fish may be small in size, but they still need plenty of room to swim, especially if you have decided to get more than one.</li>
		<li>Think about where you place your tank. Keep it out of direct sunlight, away from windows and heating. The last thing you want is for the water in the tank to heat up out of your control.</li>
		<li>Invest in a decent filter. This will keep the water in the tank cleaner for longer, removing any debris, pollutants and waste.</li>
		<li>Add an air pump. This will keep the water in the tank oxygenated and keep it moving which is great for your fish. Pumps come in different sizes depending on the amount of litres your tank can hold.</li>
	</ul>
