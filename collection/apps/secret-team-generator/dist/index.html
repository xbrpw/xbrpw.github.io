      This is a mechanism to create secret teams where players only know the identity of those on their team. 
      Enter the names and team size and press “go”. The first player will be presented with a button.
      When the player clicks that button it will reveal their secret team. The player then hits a button
      to finish, and the next player’s button will appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the team size does not divide evenly into the player count, the remaining players become "Lone Wolves".
