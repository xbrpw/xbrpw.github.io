The Gilbert font family is part of an ongoing project, Type With Pride: www.typewithpride.com

- The Gilbert Color font relies on a new color font format, OpenType-SVG.
- It can be installed on both Mac & PC but its colors will only show up on recent systems (macOS Mojave 10.14 and over) and apps (InDesign CC 2019+, Illustrator 2018+, Photoshop 2017+).
- On older systems and apps, the multicolored letters will be displayed as a black font. Gilbert Color includes such a fallback solution, so while the font might look black on your operating system, the color font data is still around: just load Photoshop CC 2017 or a more recent version and you will see the colored letters.
